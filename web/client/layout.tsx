/**
 * The document shell — this site's, not the framework's.
 *
 * A component like any other, which is why it lives here rather than beside the server: everything
 * it names is in `client/`. The one thing it cannot work out — where the client runtime was
 * compiled to — is handed to it.
 *
 * It is written the way every Remix component is: a setup function that returns a render function,
 * placed as `<Layout title={…}>…</Layout>`. Setup runs once per instance and render runs on every
 * update, so a component that only ever renders on a server still reads like one that does not.
 *
 * It also carries the one thing the browser cannot work out for itself: the map from an island's
 * name to the chunk the bundler emitted, plus the scripts that load them. A page that places no
 * island gets neither, and so ships no JavaScript at all.
 *
 * The shell's own CSS is right here too, as `css(...)` mixins. The renderer collects the mixins
 * the page rendered and writes them into `<head>`, so nothing below has a class name that has to
 * agree with a file somewhere else.
 *
 * What turns this tree into a response is `context.render`, from the `render({ assets })`
 * middleware in `router.tsx`: the doctype, the content type, and — the part that matters here —
 * `renderToStream` rather than `renderToString`. The runtime turns every internal `<a>` click into
 * a frame navigation and swaps the document only when it finds `<!-- rmx:flush document -->` at the
 * end, which `renderToString` strips; without it the URL changes while the page does not, with no
 * error anywhere. That is what keeps a plain `<a href>` working on a page with islands as well as
 * on one without.
 *
 * The social card is the other thing handed in rather than worked out here. What it says comes from
 * this page — its title and its description — but where the PNG ended up, and whether there is an
 * origin to make its URL absolute with, are things only the server knows.
 *
 * The one stylesheet it does link is `static/app.css`: the site's tokens, its document-level defaults,
 * and the `@layer base, rmx, app` statement the whole cascade hangs off. Its position in the head
 * matters — layers rank by where they are first named, and Remix appends its collected styles just
 * before `</head>`, so the link has to come first.
