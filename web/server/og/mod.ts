/**
 * The social cards: one PNG per page, drawn at build time.
 *
 * A page already says what its card should say — `title` and `description` are the two things
 * every page module exports — so a card is registered from the same values the `<head>` gets,
 * rather than from a second list of pages that could fall out of step with the first.
 *
 * `ogImage()` does both halves at once: it records how to draw the card and hands back the URL to
 * put in `<meta property="og:image">`. That is what keeps the two in step — there is no way to
 * register a card without getting its URL, and none to write the URL without registering the card.
 *
 * The registration is eager and the drawing is not. A crawler reaches a page's HTML by following
 * links; nothing links to an `og:image` (it is an absolute URL, and a crawler that followed one
 * would leave the site), so the build is handed `ogPaths()` as extra entry points and asks for the
 * images directly — possibly before it has rendered the page they belong to. So the card has to be
 * registered when the route is wired, while what it says may be worked out later: an article's
 * title lives in a file, and reading every one of them at startup to fill in a card nobody may ask
 * for is work the dev server would do on every reload.
 *
 * Where the site is deployed comes from `SITE_URL`, which the Cloudflare workflow sets for the
 * build. A link within the site does not need an origin; a card does. `og:image` is fetched by
 * someone else's server, from someone else's page, so a path is not an address — which is why a
 * local build, where there is no origin to know, writes the cards and leaves the tag relative
 * rather than inventing a host.
