/**
 * The app, wired by hand.
 *
 * Route definitions live in `client/routes.ts` and this file maps them to what answers them — the
 * shape a Remix app has. `router.map(routes, controller)` is the whole of the mapping, and a
 * controller has to name an action for every route in the map it owns: leave one out and the
 * router throws while it is being built, rather than answering a route with nothing.
 *
 * What is exported is a plain `@remix-run/fetch-router` router, and it is deployed two ways from
 * this one file:
 *
 * - **Locally** `deno serve router.tsx` answers the pages *and* the server-only routes (`/api/*`,
 *   `/.well-known/jwks.json`) live. This is also what the tests run against.
 * - **Cloudflare Workers** serves the static build below as static assets and answers only the
 *   server-only routes, from `worker.ts` — this file uses Deno-only APIs and is not deployed there.
 * - **GitHub Pages** is `@remix-kbn/ssg` crawling this same object with `fetch()` and writing each
 *   response to disk. It starts from `entryPoints` and follows links, and nothing links to the
 *   server-only routes, so `/api/*` is never generated.
